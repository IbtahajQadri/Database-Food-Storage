## ðŸš€ Client Setup Instructions: Running via Docker Image

This guide explains how to download the pre-built Docker image from our GitLab Container Registry and run the application on your local system.

> **Note:** It is assumed that Docker is already installed on your system.

### Step 1: Generate a GitLab Access Token

To access the GitLab Container Registry, you need to authenticate using a **Personal Access Token**:

1. Log in to your GitLab account.
2. Click your avatar (top left corner) and select **Edit Profile**.
3. Navigate to **Access Tokens**.
4. Create a new token named e.g., `"Container registry token"`.
5. Select the scopes:
   - `read_registry`
   - `write_registry` (optional if you donâ€™t plan to push images)
6. Click **Create personal access token** and **save the token securely** â€” you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

### Step 2: Log in to GitLab Container Registry from your Terminal

1. Go to your projectâ€™s **Container Registry** page on GitLab.
2. Click **CLI Commands** to expand the login command.
3. Copy the login command, which looks like:
   ```bash
   docker login registry.gitlab.com -u <your-username> -p <your-access-token>
   ```
4. Paste and run this command in your terminal to authenticate Docker with GitLab.

### Step 3: Pull and Run the Docker Image

1. In the Container Registry, find the image you want to run.
2. Copy the full image path (e.g., `registry.gitlab.com/thi-wi/sweng/m-egm/team-25-03:latest`).
3. Run the Docker container with:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --pull=always -p 8000:8000 registry.gitlab.com/thi-wi/sweng/m-egm/team-25-03:latest
    ```

- The flag `--pull=always` ensures Docker always pulls the latest version of the image before running.

---

### Step 4: Access the Application

Once the container is running, the web application will be accessible at:
http://localhost:8000/

Open this URL in your web browser to start using the Food Storage App.

## Notes

- Ensure Docker is installed on your system before following these steps.
- If you encounter any issues logging in or pulling the image, verify your access token and permissions.
